A lightweight compact extruder with 5:1 gearing using BMG dual drive.   It is capable of pushing up to 48mm^3/s through a 0.4 nozzle.

Footprint is a very compact 41x45mm and weighs 107g (with steel fasteners).

Regular and mirrored version.   STEP files provided.  

There also is a version of the middle body which is compatible with toolheads designed for the Scherpa extruder.

# ASSEMBLY
Assembly is fairly straightforward.  You may need to either push the white gear down 1-2 mm if it rubs on the Nema 14 motor.  Alternatively you may carefully grind off 1-2mm of the shaft.  Be careful of heat so you don't melt the nylon gear.

# TOOLHEADS

Toolheads are available for the following:
* Tiny-M Dragon Toolhead (V3 Gantry).  V4 Gantry version is (soon to be) part of Tiny-M STLs.
* Voron V0 Dragon
* Voron V0 V6 Screw Mount

There will be a Sailfin toolhead for CroXY soon.
